# august 15 created a small layout and took measurements of the mint cans also tested what will be needed for waterproofing

created a rough idea on where everything would be for now 
I took measurments and inputed them into my 3d software.
with this I can finnaly start looking into boards and what I will need.
in the meantime I took the mint can and submerged it in water to find where it would let in water so I could factor that in 
(turns out it leaks from the hinges other than that its actually quite water resistant when closed ofcs )
